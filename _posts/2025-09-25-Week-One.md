## Last Week
In this last week, my focus has been on understanding two things: REST APIs and Docker. To that end, I've been watching LinkedIn Learning material on both. I can say that I now understand the constraints of REST, so my next decision is what framework I'm going to use to implement a RESTful API of my own. 

Still to complete for this week are to write a simple "Hello World" REST API endpoint and to containerize my code with Docker, which will be completed by Sunday. 

## Looking Ahead
The work that's planned for the coming week is to beginning implementing my RESTful API. 

## Impediments
The main impediment to my work so far has been the amount of new concepts and material I need to learn to realize this project. My normal process of taking comprehensive notes on everything is a real hinderance to my progress. I desperately need a process improvement here. 

## Process Review
My current idea on how to address this is a two pass approach - initially cover all material quickly, then return to key areas to take notes on what seemed most important. Looking ahead, with SQL, AWS, and JavaScript lined up in future weeks, it will be worthwhile to improve my own learning and note-taking processes.
